# BokehAvocado
Creating an interactive visualisation of avocado price data in the United States.

This code isn't working yet. The working code is in the last few cells of [this notebook](https://github.com/thecraigd/Avocado-Prices/blob/master/Avocado%20Prices.ipynb) in my [Avocado Prices repo](https://github.com/thecraigd/Avocado-Prices).

I'll update this when I have a chance to get it working properly.
